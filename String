General Syntax for declaring a variable as a string.
char variableName [size];


Initialization of Strings
char variableName [50] = "Value is in here";

---
#include<stdio.h>

int main () {
  char book [20];
  int price;
  printf("1. What is the name of the book? : \n2. How much do you want to sell this for? : \n");
  scanf("%s %d",book,&price);               //for the scanf() to read we don't need to use & to access the variable address.
  printf("Name : %s\nPrice : %d",book,price);
  return 0;
}

//The problem of scanf() is that it doesn't read the entire strings if it contains whitespace.
//We can safely use fgets(book, sizeof bookname, stdin); to replace scanf().

.......but it has newline at the end of the string.
