//How to use do while loop
//syntax of do while loop is as follows

do {
  statements
} while (expression);

it is the same loop as while except that 'do while' loop does at least one execution.

//The difference between 'do while' loop and 'while' loop is that (expression) for 'do while' loop comes at the end.

---example
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
	int a = 1;
	
	do {
		a++;
		printf("%d,",a);
		a=a*2;
		printf("%d\n",a);
	} while (a<20);
	return 0;
}

---example
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
	int a = 2;
	
	do {
		printf("%d",a*2);             //a is still 2 but it prints 4 because it tells to print a*2 = 2*2 = 4 , a is not 4 now.
		a++;                          //a is now 3
		printf("%d\n",a);
	} while (a<20);
	return 0;
}
