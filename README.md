# C-language

I thought I might struggle with learning C language as a complete beginner.
Thankfully Youtube Algorithm suggested me this video.

This video is entitled "Things we must know before learning C language".

In the video he explains why they use base 2 numerical system. = simply because they use electricity. 
Either 'electricty ON' or 'electricty OFF'.
1011(2) = (2^3)*1 + (2^2)*0 + (2^1)*1 + (2^0)*1 = 11
It costs 4 Bits to write 1011. Because there would be '4' imaginary cords to write 1011(2). -> each digit costs one cord.
So to write 10010110(2), we need 8 Bits of memory to write this.
8 Bits = 1 byte. This is equivalent to a memory room for one letter in English.
