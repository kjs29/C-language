# C-language

I thought I might struggle with learning C language as a complete beginner.
Thankfully Youtube Algorithm suggested me this video.

This video is entitled "Things we must know before learning C language".

In the video he explains why they use base 2 numerical system(binary numerical system). = simply because they use electricity. 
Either 'electricty ON' or 'electricty OFF'.
1011(2) = (2^3)*1 + (2^2)*0 + (2^1)*1 + (2^0)*1 = 11
It costs 4 Bits to write 1011. Because there would be '4' imaginary cords to write 1011(2). -> each digit costs one cord.
So to write 10010110(2), we need 8 Bits of memory to write this.
8 Bits = 1 byte. This is equivalent to a memory room for one letter in English. 


we also use hexidecimal numerical system , shortened to 'hex'.
How we turn binary to hex.
10110011(2) : the first 4 digit(1011) would be 11, and the next  4 digit(0011) would be 3 so in decimal numerical system it is 14.
Since 10 = a,11=b,12=c,13=d,14=e,15=f
10110011(2) = b3(16)

So in hex, one digit takes 4 bits. = 0.5byte
